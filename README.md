# The-Wigner-position-and-momentum-of-states-0-to-4
Here, you will find the code written to generate data for the Wigner distribution of states 0 to 4 as well as for the respective position and momentum distributions.
All one has to do is download the files, open them via a C-programming platform (e.g. CodeBlocks) or a similar platform compatible with C-language and run them.
This will create .DAT files which contain the data of the Wigner, position and momentum distributions from -3 to +3, for a quantum harmonic oscillator. 
These files can then be used for plotting via a plotting platform (e.g. gnuplot).
